## 1. Conception

### a) Conceptual diagram

We decided to store the `Code4677` in a separate table because we would use this table since in the `Forecast` table we would have a foreign key to this table. We also decided to store the `AdjacentRegion` in a separate table because we would use this table since in the `Region` table we would have a foreign key to this table.

### b) Logical diagram

We translated one to many relations to a foreign key, and many to many relations to a junction table. We also added a primary key to each table.

## 2. Implementation

### a) Creating database

### b) Requests

## 3. Stored procedures
